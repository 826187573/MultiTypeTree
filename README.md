MultiTypeTree
=============

This is a BEAST 2 package which allows for the inference of multi-type
phylogenetic trees.  It includes a full set of proposal operators and
a structured coalescent model, allowing migration rates and
sub-population sizes to be inferred from serially-sampled sequence
data.

For further information, please refer to the MultiTypeTree [web
page](http://compevol.github.com/MultiTypeTree).
