MultiTypeTree
=============

This project is a work in progress to implement a datatype to natively
represent "multi-type trees" (phylogenetic trees on structured
populations) in [BEAST 2](http://code.google.com/p/beast2/), along
with a complete set of MCMC operators for walking the multi-type tree
space and calculators for a few common likelihood functions
(e.g. structured coalescent).

Work on this project is made possible by generous funding from the
[Allan Wilson Centre for Molecular Ecology and
Epidemiology](http://www.allanwilsoncentre.ac.nz/).
