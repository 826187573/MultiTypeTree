	<h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>MultiTypeTree is a <a href="http://beast2.org/">BEAST 2</a>
          package for performing phylogenetic inference under models
          incorporating some form of population structure.  It
          implements a "multi-type" tree object, representing a
          phylogenetic tree with every time on each edge associated
          with one of a finite number of discrete types.  These types
          often represent locations, but can in principle represent
          any well-defined sub-population.</p>

	<p>In addition to the basic object, MultiTypeTree implements a
	  full suite of proposal operators for these objects, as well
	  as the structured coalescent probability density and a
	  structured coalescent simulator.  Together, these components
	  allow for inference of trees, migration rates and population
	  sizes under the structured coalescent model.  However, we
	  stress that the system can (and will) be easily extended to
	  cope with other structured-population genealogical
	  models.</p>

	<h2>Getting Started</h2>
	
	<p>Being a BEAST 2 package, installation of MultiTypeTree is
	in general quite straight-forward.  One temporary
	complication, however, is that the package currently depends
	on BEAST 2 features which have not yet been incorporated into
	the current BEAST 2 binary release (2.0.2). Thus, both of the
	following files are required:
	<ul>
	  <li>The latest release
	  of <a href="https://github.com/CompEvol/MultiTypeTree/releases">MultiTypeTree</a>.
	  <li>A pre-release of <a href="binaries/BEAST2.0.3_pre.zip">BEAST 2.0.3</a>.
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>Once you have downloaded these files, you will need to
	<ol>
	  <li>Unzip <code>BEAST2.0.3_pre.zip</code>, which will result
	  in a new folder <kbd>BEAST2.0.3_pre/</kbd></li>
	  <li>Move the package
	  file <code>MultiTypeTree-x.y.z.zip</code> into this new
	  folder and unzip it.</li>
	</ol>
	</p>

	<p>At this point, BEAST can be executed by opening the
	folder <kbd>BEAST2.0.3_pre/</kbd> and double-clicking on the
	file <code>beast2.jar</code>. This will bring up a dialog box
	where a BEAST 2 XML file can be selected. OS X and Linux users
	can alternatively use the command
	<pre>java -jar beast2.jar filename.xml</pre> to execute BEAST
	with the XML input file <code>filename.xml</code> from the
	command line. <a href="http://www.java.com">Java</a> is required to run
	BEAST.</p>

	<h2>Tutorial: Structured coalescent analysis</h2>
	<p>The MultiTypeTree package is not currently shipped with a
	BEAUTi graphical interface.  Therefore, analyses are currently
	set up by working directly on the BEAST 2 XML input file.  In
	practice, the best way to do this is to modify the example XML
	provided in the <kbd>examples/</kbd> subdirectory of the
	MultiTypeTree package archive.</p>
